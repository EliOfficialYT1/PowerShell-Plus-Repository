PLEASE NOTE: PowerShell Plus is a fan-made version of Windows PowerShell. It does not use any code from Microsoft Corporation. Its purpose is to serve as a learning experience while having fun. :)

Please type GetPnp - Help? in the console to get help. PowerShell Plus 2.0 is an improvement over PowerShell Plus 1.0. We hope you all enjoy! :)
